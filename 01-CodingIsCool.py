Exercise 1: Coding is Cool- 10 Marks
"""

#firstly, i assigned 3 variables that are strings to hold the three words that I want to concatenate
#I know that my variable/data type is a string because it holds letters, not integers/numbers
word1 = "Coding"
word2 = "is"
word3 = "Cool"
#i also ensured that all 3 "containers" or variables have different names

#next, I concantenate all my strings with spaces in between and printed it
print(word1+" "+word2+" "+word3)
